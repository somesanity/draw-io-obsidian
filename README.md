### 📄 Markdown fragments

**Markdown fragments** are pieces of markdown that you can add to diagrams.

Right-click on the shape or element you want to bind a markdown fragment to, then select `Add data...`.  
The data name should follow the pattern `md-number`, for example: `md-1`, `md-2`.  
Next, insert the markdown text into the property.

## ❓ How It Works

This plugin launches a **local web server** that serves the [Draw.io web app](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) directly from your machine.

  * When you open your Obsidian vault and enable the plugin, it spins up the server automatically.
  * You can then create, edit, and save diagrams directly within Obsidian — **completely offline**.

## 📦 Installation Guide

there are 2 ways: 

1. using plugin for obsidian - [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
2. manually install


>📌 The `drawioclient` folder, which contains the core Draw.io application, is crucial for this plugin to function correctly. Because GitHub doesn't allow direct folder uploads and to ensure faster downloads, the `drawioclient` content is provided as an archive. A small script (`drawIoClientManager.ts`) will automatically extract it for you upon installation. Please allow a brief moment for this process to complete.!

> This only needs to be done once.

### 🛠️ How update draw.io webapp

This plugin’s main benefit is that it’s just a connector between draw.io and Obsidian. It isn't locked to any fixed version; you can manually update it by swapping the webapp folder with the one from [the official repository](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/tree/dev/src/main/webapp). Even if the plugin is no longer maintained, you can keep draw.io current on your own.
